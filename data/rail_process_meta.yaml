## General Information

description: > 
    This unit process represents the operation of Class 1 line haul rail transportation, excluding passsenger railroads (Amtrak). The data scope is cradle-to-gate, encompassing the production and combustion of diesel, and commerical transportation on a per-ton-kilometer basis. Infrastructure maintenance and expansion activities are excluded from upstream impacts in this system. Emissions factors, pollutant species, and the average Class 1 fuel efficiency were identified using R-1 submittals from the Surface Transportation Board, and the 2020 National Emissions Inventory Locomotive Methodology.

time_description: > 
    This unit process is representative of operations from 2020-2024. Pollutant species were sourced from a 2020 report. Fuel efficiency was averaged from STB R-1 data in 2024. 
geography_description: >
    This unit process is representative of Class I line haul railroad operation in the United States. Class I railroads account for 67% of rail mileage and 94% of rail revenue in the US circa 2023.
technology_description: >
    This unit process represents the operation of Class 1 line haul rail transportation, excluding passsenger railroads (Amtrak). Emissions are further specified by emissions control tier. Tiers indicate emissions standards for diesel locomotives established by the EPA, and apply to newly manufactured and remanufactured locomotives. Tiers correspond to the age and stringency of the standards: Tier 0 (1973-1992), Tier 1 (1993-2004), Tier 2 (2005-201), Tier 3 (2012-2014), Tier 4 (2015 onwards). Tiers marked with + (e.g. Tier 0+) indicate tiers inclusive of and above the indicated tier.

## LCI method

inventory_method_description: >
    Attributional process. The scope of the foreground data is use-phase and is limited to the direct combustion of diesel fuel for locomotive operation. The whole process scope is cradle-to-gate, encompassing the production and combustion of diesel, and commerical transportation on a per-ton-kilometer basis. Infrastructure maintenance and expansion activities are excluded from upstream impacts in this system. Full range of emissions covered.
modeling_constants_description: >
    Methods for compiling emissions factors are described in the 2020 NEI report. Fuel efficiency was estimated using a numerical average across all engine tiers in the year 2024. 
## Data Source information

completeness_description: >
    The mass balance for this process was not calculated. Infrastructure maintenance and expansion was not allocated to this unit process. Inventory development methods are detailed in the cited 2020 NEI report. 
data_selection_description: >
    Data selection methods for emissions factors are detailed in the 2020 NEI report. Class II and III data are not included in this inventory due to low data availability.
data_treatment_description: >
    The NEI locomotive methodology contains emissions factors on a grams pollutant per gallon fuel basis. Fuel efficiency was estimated using a numerical average across all engine tiers in the year 2024 based on STB R-1 reports. These values were paired to express emissions in terms of kg-pollutant per ton-kilometer transported. 
sampling_description: >
    Uncertainty was not calculated for this process. Sampling methods for emissions factors are described in detail in the 2020 NEI report. Production and combustion of diesel fuel is included in the scope of this process. Upstream diesel data provided by USLCI.
